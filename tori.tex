\title[]{Motivic measures and the motive of a reductive group}
\author{Julia Gordon and David Roe}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this paper is to complete a technical step in the 
``motivic" formulation of 
the representation theory of $p$-adic groups, that was started by T. Hales in 1999. 
Here  the word ``motivic'' refers to the use of the theory of motivic integration, as developed by R. Cluckers and F. Loeser in \cite{cluckers-loeser}; in this paper, no integration will be required, so ``definable'' would have been a better term to use. 

Specifically, our goal is to prove that the canonical maximal parahoric subgroup of a connected reductive $p$-adic group, as defined by  B. Gross in \cite{gross:motive} using Bruhat-Tits theory, is definable using Denef-Pas language, which is the language used in Cluckers-Loeser theory of motivic integration and, consequently,  in all its applications to representation theory of $p$-adic groups. As a consequence, we  prove that for any connected reductive group the canonical Haar measure (in the sense of \cite{gross:motive}) is motivic.
{\bf XX Can we think of the motive of a reductive group as its motivic volume? Careful though: Artin-Tate motives vs. Chow motives. think about it.}

In fact, for unramified groups this statement has been known for a while, cf. \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser}. However, for a ramified group $\bG$, there is a difficulty caused by the fact that the canonical smooth model of $\bG$, whose definition relies on the N\'eron model of a maximal torus in $\bG$, does not behave well with respect to Galois descent. Thus, the main technical difficulty we deal with in this paper is proving that the connected component of the N\`eron model of a tamely ramified torus is definable in the language of Denef-Pas. We note that this difficulty is largely caused by the fact that ``taking the connected component'' is not, naturally, an operation that can easily be described by first-order logic. 

{\bf XX Fill in: application to the formal degree ?}

\section{Tori} 
In this paper, we will use the notions of a definable set and  definable function. These refer to being definable in Denef-Pas language. 
Formulas in Denef-Pas language can have variables of three \emph{sorts}: valued field (which will be denoted by $VF$), residue field (denoted by $RF$) and the value group. Even though we will be often be working with ramified extensions, we always start with a local field $F$ with normalized valuation, so the value group is $\Z$ (the $VF$-variables will range over $F$, and so their valuations will be in $\Z$).
Formulas in Denef-Pas language can be interpreted given a choice of a valued field \emph{together with a uniformizer}. 
We refer the reader to \cite{what's the best ref?} for the definitions of Denef-Pas language, definable sets, etc. 

For us, $F$ will always be a non-Archimedean local field: either $\F_q\llp t\rrp$ or a finite extension of $\Q_p$.
As a consequence of the definition of a definable set, all statements in this paper will hold for any $F$ of sufficiently large residue characteristic $p$, 
though we will give no effective bound on $p$. 
Given an integer $M>0$, we will denote by $\loc_M$ the collection of non-Archimedean local fields that are finite extensions of $\Q_p$ or $\F_p((t))$ with residue characteristic greater than $M$. 

Since we have to assume that $p$ is large relative to some fixed parameters, such as the degree of the extension $L/F$ over which our torus splits, we may assume that $L/F$ is tame.  

For such a local field $F$, we will denote its ring of integers by $\ri_F$, its residue field by $k_F$, and let $q_F=\# k_F$. The symbol $\varpi_F$ will always stand for the uniformizer of the valuation on $F$; when there is no possibility of confusion, we might drop the subscript $F$. 
A formula in Denef-Pas language  with $n$ free $VF$-variables, $m$ free $RF$-variables, and $r$ free 
$\Z$-variables 
defines a subset of $F^n\times k_F^m \times \Z^r$. 
We will denote the definable set $F^n\times k_F^m \times \Z^r$ itself by $VF^n\times RF^m\times \Z^r$. In earlier works on motivic integration this set was denoted by $h[n,m,r]$. 

We start by setting up the framework for working with tori in the Denef-Pas language, following \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser}, \cite{CGH-2} and \cite{hales:transfert}.



\subsection{Fixed choices}

As in \cite{hales:transfert}*{\S 2.1}, we begin by outlining our \emph{fixed choices}, which are made before writing any formulas in the Denef-Pas language.  
In this way, we split the definition of the torus $\bT$ into choices made without reference to the base field $F$ and formulas determining the dependence on $F$.

We fix a finite group $\Gamma$ and a normal subgroup $I \unlhd \Gamma$, as well as enumerations of their elements $\Gamma = \{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_m\}$ and $I = \{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_e\}$.  These groups will play the role of $\Gal(L/F)$ and its inertia subgroup, where $L$ is the splitting field of $\bT$.

We now set up character and cocharacter lattices for $\bT$.  We begin by fixing a positive integer $n$, an abstract split torus ${\bT}^\spl$ and an isomorphism $X^\ast(\bT^\spl) \cong \Z^n$.
\footnote{in contrast to \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser}, where they parameterize $X^\ast(\bT^\spl)$ using valued field variables, since they need characters as functions to $F^\times$.}

In order to define $\bT$ from $\bT^\spl$, we fix a homomorphism
\[
\theta : \Gamma \to \GL_n(\Z).
\]

\subsection{Field extensions}
 

We encode field extensions in the same way as in \cite{CGH-2}. Namely, we fix a finite group $\Gamma$, and realize all tori over a given local field $F$ that split over a Galois extension $L$ with the Galois group 
isomorphic to $\Gamma$ as members of a family of definable sets, for all $F$ of sufficiently large residue characteristic. 

Thus, once and for all, we fix a pair $(\Gamma,I)$,  with $\Gamma$ an abstract finite group, with fixed enumeration of its elements, $\Gamma=\{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_m\}$, and 
$I=\{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_e\}$
a normal subgroup (which will play the role of the inertia subgroup). We will also need to use the maximal unramified sub-extension of $L$.
There is an exact sequence of Galois groups, 
$$ 1\to I \to \gal(L/F)\to \gal(L^{ur}/F)\to 1.$$
We 
%fix the ramification index $e$, and make the convention that the elements
%$\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_e$ of $\Gamma$ constitute the group $\gal(L/L^{\ur})$, and 
make the convention that $\sigma_m$ projects to a generator of $L^{\ur}$ over $F$. 
In order to encode the data of the extension tower $L/L^{\ur}/F$, we let $f=m/e$ and introduce parameters $b_0,\dots, b_{f-1}$, ranging over $\ri_F$.
We set $b(x)=x^f+b_{f-1}x^{f-1}+ \dots + b_0$ and identify $L^{ur}$ with $F[x]/(b(x))$. 
Similarly, we introduce parameters $c_0, \dots, c_{e-1}$, ranging over $L^{\ur}$
(i.e., each is given by an $f$-tuple of elements of $F$), set $c(x) = x^e + c_{e-1}x^{e-1} + \dots + c_0$ and identify $L$ with $L^{\ur}[x]/(c(x))$. 
We impose the conditions (all of which are definable by formulas in the Denef-Pas language) that: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the reduction of $b(x)$ modulo $\varpi_F$ is irreducible over $k_F$. 
This ensures that $F[x]/(b(x))$ is a degree $f$ unramified field extension of $F$. 
We denote this extension by $L^\ur$, and once and for all fix an identification with $F^f$ as 
an $F$-vector space. 
\item the polynomial $c(x)$ is Eisenstein: $\ord_{L^{\ur}}(c_0) = 1$ and $\ord_{L^{\ur}}(c_i) \ge 1$ for all $i$.
We further assume that the resulting extension $L/F$ is Galois.
We fix an identification of $L$ with $(L^\ur)^e$ as $L^\ur$-vector spaces, and thus with $F^m$ as $F$-vector spaces. 
\item $\sigma_1, \dots \sigma_m$ are distinct field automorphisms of $L$ over $F$, and 
 $\sigma_1, \dots \sigma_e$ fix $L^\ur$.
\item The restriction of $\sigma_m$ to $L^\ur$ is a generator of $\gal(L^\ur/F)$. 
\item the group $\{\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n\}$ is isomorphic to $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}
We denote by $\cE_\Gamma$ the space of parameters $(b_0, \dots, b_{f-1}, c_0, \dots, c_{e-1}, \sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n)$ with these properties, thought of as a definable subset of some large affine space over $F$. 
Given a field $F$ of sufficiently large residue characteristic, every element of $\cE_\Gamma$ gives rise to a tower of field extensions $L/L^\ur/F$ with $\gal(L/F)$ isomorphic to $\Gamma$ and satisfying all the above conditions. Note, however, that we cannot quite distinguish between 
isomorphism classes of extensions, but all extensions of a given field $F$ with Galois group 
$\Gamma$ arise via this construction.   
\begin{example}
The two ramified quadratic extensions of $F$ appear as members of the same family, one for the 
polynomial $x^2-\varpi$, another for the polynomial $x^2-\epsilon\varpi$, where $\epsilon$  is any non-square unit. We also recall that the interpretation of formulas in Denef-Pas language depends not just on the field, but also on the choice of the uniformizer of the valuation. Thus, in this case, a different choice of the uniformizer would cause these two extensions to switch places, but they would still both appear. 
\end{example}
\begin{rem} We observe that in this context we cannot use standard number-theoretic constructions involving objects such as the cyclotomic polynomial, since we need to be able to let $F$ with its residue characteristic vary, and thus polynomials whose degree depends on $p$ are not allowed. For the same reason, we cannot use the Frobenius automorphism.  
\end{rem}
Our goal is to construct all tori over $F$ that split over a Galois extension with Galois group 
$\Gamma$ and inertia subgroup $I$, and the identity components of their N\'eron models, as 
definable sets fibered over $\cE_\Gamma$.  

\subsection{The set-up}
We follow \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser} in the treatment of the character and cocharacter lattices.
We will think of a split rank $n$ torus ${\bT}^\spl$ as the set of diagonal matrices in $\GL_n$, which is, clearly, definable. Its character lattice $X^\ast({\bT}^\spl)$ is viewed as a subset of the coordinate ring of $\bT^\spl$, whose elements are, explicitly, polynomials in $n^2$ variables. 
We also fix, once and for all, an isomorphism between $X^\ast(\bT^\spl)$ and $\Z^n$. 
\footnote{As pointed out in \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser}, this makes it tempting to represent 
$X^\ast(\bT^\spl)$ by constants (or variables) of the $\Z$-sort in Denef-Pas language, but this, indeed, is a wrong way to proceed.}
From now on, together with the groups $\Gamma$ and $I$, we shall fix a homomorphism
$\theta:\Gamma \to \GL_n(\Z)$, as part of the initial completely field-independent `fixed data' built into all our constructions.
Moreover, the set $H^1(\Gamma, \GL_n(\Z))$ is completely field-independent, and therefore can also be fixed from the start. The trivial class is represented by the map $\theta$.  We can, and will, fix a set of representatives of these cohomology classes, and denote them by $Z=\{z_1, \dots, z_m\}$. We will use the $z_i$ in Denef-Pas formulas, thinking of them as $|\Gamma|$-tuples of $n\times n$-matrices whose integer entries are \emph{constants of the valued  field sort}. 
 
For $\epsilon=(\bar b, \bar c, \sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n)\in \cE_\Gamma$, we get an extension tower 
$L_\epsilon/L_\epsilon^\ur/F$. For $z\in Z$, define the action of $\gal(L/F)$ on $\bT^\spl(L)$ by
$\sigma\cdot  t:=z(\sigma)\sigma^{-1}t$, where $t\in \bT^\spl(L)$, and for $\sigma\in \Gamma$, 
$\sigma^{-1}t$ is the coordinate-wise action of $\sigma^{-1}$, which is thought explicitly as an $n\times n$-matrix with entries that are definable functions of the parameters $(\bar b, \bar c)$, on the coordinates of $t$, which are thought of as elements of $L$, i.e., as tuples of $F$-variables. 

The $F$-tori that split over $L$ are in bijection with  the set $Z$; 
for $z\in Z$, we denote the corresponding algebraic $F$-torus by $\bT_z$. 
By the above construction, the set of its $F$-points $\bT_z(F)$ is definable by a formula in Denef-Pas language (using parameters in $\cE_\Gamma)$, since it is the set of fixed points of the action defined in the above paragraph. 

\subsection{The connected component of the N\'eron model: induced case}
Let us first consider the case $\bT=\Res_{L/F} \bT^\spl$, where $L$ is a finite Galois extension with Galois group $\Gamma$ as above. This is equivalent to choosing a cocycle $z$ that gives the action on $X^\ast(\bT^\spl)\simeq \Z^n$ induced from the trivial action. 
% Note that this condition on $z$ is definable. ({\bf XX Do we need this? If no, maybe remove, if yes, provide detail}).
Write $\Ner{T}$ for the N\'eron model of $\bT$, and $\NerC{T}$ for its identity component.  Then $\Ner{T}(\ri_F) = \bT(F) = L^\times$ consists of tuples of $F$-variables that are not all zero, and $\NerC{T}(\ri_F) = \ri_F^\times$ consists of tuples of $F$-variables all with non-negative valuation -- both are definable conditions.

We observe that in this case the component group of $\Ner{T}$ can be identified with $\Z^n$, and here we interpret $\Z^n$ as the value sort. The map $v:\Ner{T} \to \pi_0(\Ner{T})$ is the component-wise valuation: we treat an element of $L$ as an $n$-tuple of elements of $F$, and $v$ maps it to the  tuple of valuations of the components. 

\subsection{The connected component of the N\'eron model: an outline}

We want to show that the identity component of the N\'eron model is definable.  Consider the short exact sequence of $\Gal(L/F)$-modules
\[
0 \to X^*(\bT) \to \Ind_{G_F}^{G_L} X^*(\bT) \to X' \to 0
\]
defined in \cite{brahm}*{Satz 0.4.4} and the dual sequence of tori
\[
1 \to \Res_{L/F}^1(\bT_L) \to \Res_{L/F} (\bT_L) \to \bT \to 1.
\]
Write $\bS = \Res_{L/F} (\bT_L)$ and $\Ner{S}$ for the N\'eron model of $\bS$; $\bR = \Res_{L/F}^1 (\bT_L)$ and $\Ner{R}$ for its N\'eron model. 
%We have the exact sequence of N\'eron models 
%\[
%1 \to \Ner{R} \to \Ner{S} \to \Ner{T} \to 1, 
%\]
%and the resulting sequence of component groups 
We seek a formula that tests when a given element of $\bT(F)$ actually lies in $\NerC{T}(\ri_F) \subseteq \Ner{T}(\ri_F) = \bT(F)$. The set $\bS(F) \cong (L^\times)^n$ is definable, as is the valuation map to the component group of its N\'eron model, $v : \bS(F) \to \pi_0(\Ner{S}) \cong \Z^n$.  The image of $\pi_0(\Ner{R})$ in $\pi_0(\Ner{S})$ is independent of $F$ (as can be seen from \cite{bertrapelle-gonzales:13b}*{Prop. 3.8}), so we may fix generators $r_1, \ldots, r_m$ for use in our formulas.  The functor $\bT \mapsto \pi_0(\Ner{T})$ is right exact \cite{bertrapelle-gonzales:13b}*{Prop. 3.8}, so to determine whether a given element $t \in \bT(F)$ lies in $\NerC{T}(\ri_F)$, it suffices to check if there exists an element of $\bS(F)$ projecting to $t$ with valuation in the span of $r_1, \ldots, r_m$.  This is a definable condition.
Thus, to implement this construction precisely, we need to introduce the fixed choice 
$r_1, \dots, r_m$ and the suitable compatibility conditions. 


\subsection{}More precisely, we need to make fixed choices of $z_1, \dots z_n$. 
There is a compatibility condition -- the quotient of $\Z^n$ by the lattice generated by this fixed choice should be $(X_\ast)_I$, which is already fixed at this point. 
Rename the $z$'s -- $z$ is reserved for cocycle.  

\section{General reductive groups}
%{\bf XX Here want to prove that $G_{x, 0}$ is definable; canonical measure is motivic; formal degree is motivic. }
It is shown in \cite{CGH-2} that for all $r>0$ and any \emph{optimal} point $x$ in the building, the Moy-Prasad filtration subgroups $G_{x, r}$ are definable; here we fill in the last missing case, namely, we prove that $G_{\ff}:=G_{x, 0}$ (with $x$ in the interior of the facet $\ff$)   is definable for  all facets $\ff$.  

We treat reductive groups in the definable setting as in \cite{hales:transfert} and \cite{CGH-2}.
In particular, we have the \emph{fixed choices} that include the absolute root datum of $G$ and the root datum of $G$ over the maximal unramified extension; the Galois action on the absolute root datum, and, finally,  a finite set that encodes the set of faces of an alcove in the building of $G$ over the maximal unramified extension.

We recall that each  fixed choice determines  a split reductive group $G^{\ast\ast}$ and an embedding 
$G^{\ast\ast}(F)\hookrightarrow GL_N(F)$ for every local field $F$ of sufficiently large residue characteristic.  
Moreover, as in \cite{hales:transfert}*{\S 2.2}, we  have a parameter space $Z$ that encodes field extensions and Galois cocycles, so that a pair 
$(\Sigma, z)$ determines a connected reductive group $G(F)$ for every local field $F$ of sufficiently large residue characteristic, and every reductive group (up to isomorphism)  arises via this construction. 
(We recall that here $\Sigma$ is a fixed choice determining $G^{\ast\ast}$, and $z$ is a parameter that ranges over $F^m$ for some $m$ and determines a field extension over which $G$ splits, and the Galois cocycle that corresponds to $G$). 

Our main result is that 
the compact subgroup $G(F)_\ff$ associated with $\ff$ via Bruhat-Tits theory is definable.  

%which a reductive group with a given definable family of definable sets $G(F)$ that

\begin{prop} Let $G$ be a tamely ramified quasi-split connected reductive group defined over a local field $F$. Let $\ff$ be a facet in the building of $G$. 
Then $G(F)_\ff\subset G(F)$ arises in a definable family of definable sets. 
In particular, the canonical parahoric of $G$ defined in \cite{gross:motive} is definable. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $T$ be a maximal torus containing the maximal split torus in $G$; let $x$ be the baricentre of $\ff$.
By definition, $G_x$ is generated by $T_x$ and $U_\psi$, where $U_\psi$ are the filtration subgroups of the unipotent one-parameter subgroups $U_{\alpha}$. 
We have shown in Proposition \ref{} above that  $T(F)_x$ is definable. The rest of the proof is identical to that of Lemma 3.4 in \cite{CGH-2}.  
\end{proof} 

As an immediate consequence, we obtain that the canonical measure is motivic, up to a motivic constant. 
We recall that a \emph{motivic constant} is an element of the ring of constructible motivic functions on a point, i.e.,  of $A:=\Z[\lef, \lef^{-1}, \frac{1}{1-\lef^{-i}}, i>0]$. 
This statement was previously known for unramified reductive groups, \cite{cluckers-hales-loeser}. 

For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local field $F$, we denote the \emph{canonical Haar measure} on $G(F)$ in the sense of \cite{gross:motive} by $d\mu_G^\can$. 
\begin{theorem} For every fixed choice $\Psi$ of a root datum there exists $M>0$ that depends only on 
$\Psi$, a  definable set $\bG \to Z$, a family of  motivic measures $d\mu_z$ on $G_z$, and a motivic function $c:Z\to A$, such that for every $F\in \loc_M$: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item $G_z(F)$ is a connected reductive group over $F$ with root datum $\Psi$;
\item $c_F(z) d\mu_{G_z}^\can = d\mu_{z, F}$.
 \end{itemize} 
\end{theorem}
